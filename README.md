## Halo 👋

I am an academic and researcher at the Faculty of Animal Science, Gadjah Mada University, specializing in genetics, genomics, livestock, bioinformatics, and animal breeding. 

I focus on genetic diversity and adaptation in livestock, particularly poultry, my research has contributed significantly to understanding genetic polymorphisms and adaptations to environmental stressors such as heat. 

My work includes genomic analysis of Nigerian indigenous chickens and studies on genetic markers in cattle. 

I collaborates with international research institutions including the University of Nottingham, CTLGH, ILRI and has published in peer-reviewed journals with citations recognizing her contributions to livestock genetics and genomics.

Please contact me via email to initiate collaboration!
